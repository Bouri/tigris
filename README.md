# tigris
Download and use Census TIGER shapefiles in R

`tigris` is an R package that allows users to directly download and use TIGER/Line shapefiles (<https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html>) from the US Census Bureau.  The package is very early in development; not all geographies are supported, not everything is well-documented yet, and the API is subject to change.  

To install the package, issue the following command in R: 

```
devtools::install_github('walkerke/tigris')
```

For more information on how to use this package, please view the RPubs at <http://rpubs.com/walkerke/tigris>.
